Corner of Black Avenue and Moonlight Row~
As you stand on the corner of Black Avenue and Moonlight row,
you know for sure that this is the busiest spot in town. There
are literally tons of people coming and going constantly because
there is only one turbolift that leads to this sector which
just happens to be to the north from here.

see many citizens crowding the area and getting in your way.
This area is dimly lit and may be a bad area to be at night.

You stand at the corner of Dagger Avenue and Cora Street. You
see that both ways look nice, but Dagger Ave. doesn't have much
on it as far as shops and homes go, especially when it is compared
to the infamous Cora Street.

don't like pretty things so they would take Dagger Avenue, but
most people love beautiful things and would rather take Vine
Street to see all of its vegetation.
