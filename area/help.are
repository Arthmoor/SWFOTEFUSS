The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were

area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+

0 ADARI ADARIAN~
an alien race native to the planet Adari, the Adarians are humanoids with 
unusual cranial structures. Their skulls are elongated and tall, and havea 
large hole which goes completely through it. They have no ears or noses, and 
their mouth is ringed with sharp, bony ridges instead of lips. The Adarians 
make up to the lack of ears with a covering of fine hairs along their skulls 
that pick up the vibration of sound waves. A series of glands near the skin's 
surface allows them to smell. Their throats can be distended and filled with 
air, and the resulting "long call" can be useful as a communication method or a 
kind of defensive action. The Adarians have a rigid caste system which 
dominates their society, and the have evolved an advanced technology based on 
the use of super-cooled carbon-ice computers. They were able to remain neutral 
during the Galactic Civil War by signing a non-agression treaty with the 
Empire, providing the Empire with unlimited raw materials in return for their 
neutrality.

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

31 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

31 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~

organizations. They may be captured by organizations with the capture
command. Type GOVERNMENTS for a list. 3. The SENATE: The senate was
restored by the New republic shortly after the battle of Endor. It has
since then broken off its direct ties with the New Republic in order to
include the council heads from all worlds including Imperial controlled
worlds. The senate meets monthly at the traditional senate hall on
coruscant. However because of the difficulty that imperials face flying
near coruscant a shuttle has been set up that provides safe transportation
from a nuetral outpost to the Senate hall. The senate hall also has a
series of opinion booths were council heads can comunicate with their
people. These opinion booths are also used for electing new council heads.

0 COYNITE~
the fierce, warrior race which was native to the planet Coyn, the Coynites
stand nearly three meters tall. Their bodies are covered with fine fur,
which ranged in color from white or gold to brown and black. Their heads
were crowned by a  mane of longer hair, and the length of the mane
indicated the individual's social status. Coynites are natural warriors,
and almost always wear some form of battle armor and weapon.
Xenobiologists have guessed that the average Coynite  could live to be 250
standards years old, but most males died in combat by the time they were
55. They hold to a rigid system of ritual and honor codes known as the
En'Tra'Sol, that governed not only battle but politics. Offworlders have 
been killed for not adhering to this code. The Coynites respected and
admired the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic, since the Jedi Code was
similar to the En'Tra'Sol in many respects.

0 DEFEL "AF'EL"~
Defel are an Alien species that appear as large, red-eyed shadows under most 
lighting conditions. This has given rise to their common name:
Wraiths. Under Ultraviolet light, Defels appear as stocky, fur-covered bipeds 
with protruding snouts and long, clawed, triple-jointed fingers.
They stand about 1.3 meters tall, with shoulders as wide as 1.2 meters across. 
This species lives in underground cities on the planet Af'El, where most 
inhabitants make their living through mining and metallurgy. In the galaxy at 
large, Defel often find employment as hired muscle, spies, and assassins due to 
their shadowy forms.

Defel can't wear armor because it would interfere wit htheir natural
invisibility. However the fact that they are nearly impossible to see makes
them very difficult to hit.

0 DEVARONIAN~
these aliens are one of the most unique races in the galaxy, as their male
and female sexes are so vastly different in appearance and temperament.
The males are docile, non-aggresive creatures with smooth, hairless skin
and short horns  on their heads. They takes great pride in their horns,
and groom them quite regularly. The females, on the other hand, are
covered in calico fur and do not have horns. They are aggressive by
nature, and tend to dominate their culture.  It is believed that they are
descended from a race of primates that lived in the mountains of Devaron,
their homeworld, and that their horns were a genetic mutation that proved
useful in fending off predatory brids. Devaronians are  carnivores and in
general, have an efficient metabolism, consuming nearly every bit of food
they eat. Devaronians were one of the first races to discover the secrets
to space travel and develop stardrives.  
~

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):

 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.

shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.

-1 DIKU~
Realms of Despair was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.

limbs attached to the foward segments have evolved into arms and hands. This 
ancient species comes from a secret, unknown world. They can be encountered on 
all types of worlds and even in deep space, where it seems they n eed to 
artificial protection. The Star Dragons have a deep-rooted sense of morality 
and honor, and most have at least some sensitivity to the Force. There are even 
tales that tell of an ancient time when Duinuoqwuin served as Jedi Knights.

Because of their enormous size Duinouqwuin cannot wear armor. However they
have excellent hit points and regeneration rate. They also fave the unique
ability to fly. They are also very strong in the force.

advanced technologically. Most Duros are interested in space travel, and
are employed in one of the many industries that deal in travel between the
stars. Those Duros  who remain near their homeworld work for one of the
many starship construction facilities that orbit the planet Duro. Many of
the Duros found off-planet are graduates of the Duro Academy of Deep Space
Exploration, and can navigate a  hyperspace jump with limited star
charting.

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

31 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA

repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."
~

0 EWOK ENDOR~
The Curious, furred bipeds native to Endor's forest moon are called Ewoks. 
Standing about one meter tall, the tribal Ewoks have yet to advance beyond 
spears and bows, but their understanding of forest lore and survival skills 
cannot be matched by a more advanced species. These Hunter gatherers live in 
village clusters built high within the moon's giant trees. Easily startled, the 
Ewoks are nonetheless brave, alert, and loyal, and they can be fierce warriors 
when necessary. The Ewok language is liquid and expressive, and most humans and 
other aliens can learn to speak it. Ewoks, conversely can learn Basic, though 
they often mix in many words from their own language. During the day, Ewoks 
come down out of their tree villages to hunt and forage on the forest floor. At 
night, the forest belongs to huge carnivores, and even the youngest Ewoks know 
not to venture out after dark. The Ewoks' mystical beliefs contain many 
references to the Force, though it is never named as such. They are a musical 
species, are overly curious, and are loyal to their tribes and friends.

~

31 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

31 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a power through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

0 FALLEEN~
a reptilian alien race characterized by their cool, calculating demeanor.
They despised mammalian races as inferior to their cold, reptilian
cousins. They were covered with small scales, and often had a topknot of
hair on their heads. Their  scales change color with their emotions, and
they exude intense pheromones when they want to. The males use these
pheromones to attract females. The Falleen are humanoid in stature, and
have clawed fingers and toes. Their ancestors lived in  the water, and
most Falleen litters are birthed in the water. They have evolved into what
some consider the most beautiful of all humanoid races. As a people, the
Falleen existed in a feudal society, with noble houses ruling over lower 
classes of artisans, workers, and slaves.

0 FIGHT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob> to
get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one on
one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may also
FEEL IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob if you
have force ability.   You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many
powers and skills available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight
is to KILL <mob>. Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes
the mob to yell out. You may also set it up to flee automatically once you
go below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy,
type WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy,
flee, and recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing
the greatest loss.

tall humanoids native to the planet Firrerre, they beings have unique
striped hair, nictitating mebranes covering their eyes, and golden skin
which turns silver when scarred. They possessed limited spacefaring
technology, and had only  recently perfected sublight travel when Hethrir
convinced them to head for nearby planets while being held in hibernation.
Those that were placed on the colony ships are the only surviving
Firrerreo, because Hethrir later turned the  planet over to the Empire,
which destroyed the ecosystem with a biological weapon. Hethrir had been
raiding the colony ships for slaves over the years, until his death at the
hands of the being Waru. The Firrerreo have strong clan  affiliations, and
a fair amount of Force sensitivity. They rarely used their given names
aloud, but the use of Firrerreo's name compelled the being to obey the
speaker.

is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

1 FLOAT~
Syntax: feel 'float' <character>
 
This power enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), makes a character float slowly to the ground when
falling from in the air, and allows you to move over water and through the
air.
 
Some water areas require the use of float to prevent damage from drowning.
If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, then you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast float immediately.
~

31 'FLOAT'~
Syntax:  cast 'float' <character>
 
The power enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), as well as in preventing damage taken when falling
and in preventing an opponent from tripping you.  It does not allow you
to travel through areas which require you to fly, however.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>
 
This power enables the target character to fly.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.
 
Some water areas require the use of fly to prevent damage from drowning.

'Follow' starts you following another character.  To stop following, type
'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows a leader to disband his group (members stop following

who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

31 FORCE~
Syntax:  force <victim> <command>
Syntax:  force all <command>
 
Force forces one mob or character to execute a command.
 
FORCE 'all' forces _all_ everywhere in the game to execute a command,
typically used for 'force all save'.
 
Note that the level required to use force on mobs can be different
than the level required to use force on players, and can be adjusted
via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

0 FORCE~
The force is an essential part of our nature  like energy or matter  but it
has yet to be quantified or analyzed. The force is not to be understood in
the same manner as the physical qualities of the universe.  The laws of
physics are observable; technology is predictable and readily-controlled.
The Force is neither controlled nor controlling  it is a part of life
itself; asking if it controls or can be controlled is like asking  if a
person can control his component cells, or the cells control him.
 
It is not known whether the force has always been, came about as life
evolved into intelligence, or if it coerced the evolution of intelligence.
To the Jedi, it does not matter. Its enough to know the force IS.
~

31 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~

1 FORETHOUGHT~

Used to help in changing a character's password if they have forgotten or
misplaced their own.
 
This command will return the encrypted form of the specified password for
the specified character name.  Password and character name are case
sensitive, and the character name _must_ be capitalized.  The resulting
encrypted password must then be pasted into the character's pfile offline
by someone with access to player files.
 
~

31 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.

0 GAMORR GAMORREAN~
~

1 GAMORREAN GAMORREANS~
The Gamorrean people are known for their brutish, porcine appearance, 
along with their great strength and minute intelligence.  Green skinned
with pig-like snouts, they are among the Galaxy's best laborors and
mercenaries. They also have impressive stamina, allowing them to with-
stand large assaults and physical trauma.

When Gamorr was discovered, the populace was enslaved.  Those who
escaped this fate quickly traveled offworld to sell their services to
outsiders as guards and mercenaries.  Now, thanks to their superb idiocy,
they have been abandoned as a source of slave labor.
~

0 GAND~
a species of sentient life that has developed in the gases of the planet
Gand. Able to survive in the various gases, they require special breathing
apparatus in order to survive in oxygen-based atmospheres. The lungs of
the Gand are quite  efficient, able to utilize nearly 85 percent of the
atmosphere they breathe in with each breath. The Gand have developed a
totalitarian monarchy, and various colonies of Gand live in pockets of
mist in the gas giant's atmosphere. When  renegade Gand are sought,
findsmen are sent out to locate them. The Gand hold their names in great
reverence. A Gand who has accomplished nothing in his life is simply known
as "Gand." When a Gand completes a task, they are given their  family's
surname. A further accomplishment provides the Gand with a proper name.
Pronouns are almost never used, and are reserved for those famous Gand who
have accomplished so much that their deeds are known by all. If a Gand
does something  to be ashamed of, or causes offense to another Gand, their
name is reduced. It was discovered Gand have certain regenerative
properties.

~

0 GOKU~
Previously I was ackbar and no not the original Ackbar. I worked at DoE for
a while and eventually got fed up with the coruption so I ended up
leaving. I pretty much quit mudding and to this day don't enjoy mudding
but I still enjoy messing with code. So thats the purpose of this. Just a
hobby. When I feel enough has been done to make it worth releasing this I
will. Then anyone who wants to is welcome to use it as they wish. This mud
is rp encouraged, however not enforced. Players who we feel are doing a
good job of rping will be awarded RP points. These can be redeamed for
different things including gold, a restore, or something of that nature.

1 GOSSIP~
Syntax : gossip <message>

~

0 GOTAL~
a humanoid race which possesses a limited ability to sense the Force, the
Gotal have grey fur, and two cone-like horns on top of their heads. These
horns are actually nerve-filled receptors that register the presence of
infrared, radio,  light, and electromagnetic emissions. These cones also
have the ability to sense the presence of the Force as a vague buzzing.
They come from a moon called Antar 4, and have an instinctual distrust of
droids, for the droids' energy emissions  foul up their sensitive horns.
The Gotal have come to rely on their cones for a great many things and, as
a consequence, they have a hard time interpreting the emotions of other
races. The one emotion most Gotal are sure of is love, and  falling in
love at first sight is a common occurance among prospective mates. When
two Gotals mate, they do so for life and begin raising a family as soon as
possible. The Gotal are a race of hunters, and have little or no political
 affiliations. They have one of the few societies which exists in a
peaceful anarchy. The Gotal resisted entry into the Old Republic, but had
absolutely no desire to join the Empire. 
~

30 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

See REDIT.
~

0 GRAN~
a race of three-eyed humanoids native to the planet Kinyen, the Gran have
tan skin. Their eyes are set out away from their heads on thick stalks,
and they have large ears. Their eyes are adapted for seeing into the
visible spectrum as  well as the infrared spectrum. They evolved from a
herbivorous species, and have two stomachs to digest their food. The
females have three breasts, which they use to suckle their young. In
general, Gran are peaceful and hospitable, and no  conflicts have been
noted in their 10,000 year history. Their infrared sight allows the Gran
to detect their companion's emotional state. The Gran race was hesitant to
join the galactic community of the Old Republic, fearing that they  would
become diluted by huge distances. They remained isolated from the
Republic, for the most part, and the Old Republic respected their wishes.
After the birth of the New Order, the Gran organized peaceful protests
against  Palpatine's rule. However, they were quickly subjugated by the
Empire. On their own, the Gran developed space travel, and have developed
a healthy trade route.

1 GRENADES~
.
Syntax : Arm (grenade)
 
This skill allows you to arm grenades, before using them.
Ussually combined with the throw skill.
~

1 GRIP~
This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

1 HAIL~
Syntax: hail <ship> <message>

Allows you to hail a ship with a message.

P.S. You may be looking for CALL.
~

1 HARM~
Syntax : feel harm <victim>

Causes damage to victim.
~

31 HEDIT~
Syntax:  hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you.  The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.

31 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

30 HELPFILE FILE HELPFILES~
To edit/make a help file there are some basic and yet confusing
commands
necessary.  So here we go...
hedit <helpfile>
hset level 1 <helpfile>
hset keyword "<word list>" <helpfile>
hset save <helpfile>
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully HIDE, other characters and creatures cannot see you
unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.
 
If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.
 
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
~

1 HIJACK~
.
Syntax : Hijack
 
This skill allows you to "borrow" other peoples ships

&w&RWarning:&W If you are caught using this skill, it is ample reason to kill you.
~

1 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

31 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.
~

1 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points. Everyone starts with an even
500.
And goes back to the dirt with 500, maximum.
 
 
SEE ALSO: STUN, DEATH, CLONING
~

31 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
Humans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races.  They possess 
no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties.  Because of
this, Humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a variety of
classes and roles.
 
Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish head.
Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.
 
~

0 HUTT HUTTS~
An obese race, the Hutts are among the Galaxy's most despicable low-lifes. 
They live on their adopted homeworld of Nal Hutta, having completely
strip-mined their original home.  Due to their great size, they lack any
appreciable dexterity, however such size does lend itself to some added
protection. In addition, many have keen minds and a good deal of common
sense, probably due to the fact that they are constantly trying to kill
one another.
 
Centering their entire lives around the aquisition of power and wealth, 
their is little art, of any type, associated with them.  Some do, however,
keep collections for mere boasting value.
~

1 HYPERSPACE LIGHTSPEED~
.
 Syntax :  Calculate (system) (x) (y) (z)
             Then Hyperspace or Lightspeed
 
Hyperspace is used to jump from one system to another in the
galaxy. It is much faster than conventional space travel
as well as a bit more dangerous. If you get a Jump warning
odds are you will collide with something when you jump into
the system
~

1 I~
.               COMMANDS FOR YOUR CHARACTER
              -----------------------------
  *AFK - this adds an 'Away From Keyboard' flag to your name
 
  *CONFIG - lists all the config options available to you
 
  *DESCRIPTION - you can write a description for your character
 
  *PASSWORD <old> <new> - changes your password
 
  *TITLE <sentence> - changes the sentence behind your name
 
  *SAVE - saves your progress (good idea to do it often)
 
  *PRACTICE <skill, power, weapons> - trains you to use a skill, power, etc...
  *NOTE* Typing PRACTICE will show you all your powers, skills, etc...
         HELP <power, skill, etc> - will define the power, skill, etc...

  *SLIST - lists the powers you will receive and at what level

  *QUIT - quits the game
 
  * ! - will repeat the last command
~

0 I3~
Syntax: i3 <option>

Note: You must meet the mud's minimum level requirement before accessing I3.
You will be notified when you have reached the approptiate level.

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3ignore <string>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3invis
Toggle I3 color output                 : i3color

i3chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist afk&D will list all
  muds who have &Wafk&D as part of their listing.

i3mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

See these general commands: I3TELL, I3FINGER, I3EMOTE, I3LOCATE, I3WHO, I3IGNORE

See these administrative commands: I3UCACHE, I3USER, I3BAN,
I3SETUP, I3CHANEDIT, I3CHANLAYOUT, I3ADDCHAN, I3REMOVECHAN, I3CHANADMIN,
I3CONNECT, I3DISCONNECT, I3PACKETDEBUG, I3CONFIG
~

113 I3ADDCHAN~
Syntax: i3addchan <channelname> <localname> <type>

The channelname should be what shows up on the router's list and is displayed
on the 'i3chanlist all' command.

Localname should be the local name you want it listed as on the mud.

Type can be one of the following:

0: selectively banned
1: selectively admitted
2: filtered - valid for selectively admitted ONLY

Selectively banned channels are public channels, open to all.
Selectively admitted channels are private channels, by invite only.

Filtering is not yet implemented in this client code, but is used to scrub
the content of a private channel by its host before it is sent out to those who are
subscribed. As noted, this CANNOT be done on a public channel ( yet ).

New channels default to "Mort" permission.

See I3PERMSET for more information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3ADMINCHAN~
Syntax: i3adminchan <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>

This command is used to administer the list of muds authorized to use a channel.

When used with a public channel, "add" bans them from using it, and "remove" unbans them.
When used with a private channel, "add" allows them to use it, and "remove" disallows them.

This is all handled on a per mud basis.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3BAN~
Syntax: i3ban <target>
Syntax: i3ban IP:Port

This is the mud-wide version of an I3IGNORE command. Best used in elevated cases
where indivudual users have been unable to effectively block traffic from another
user or mud who is harassing them, or harassing multiple users on your mud.
This is a somewhat drastic measure and all traffic from the individual user or
mud will be dropped silently. It is usually best to have documented cases of
individual abuse before proceeding to this level. If blocking at this level fails
to stop the problem, you may wish to proceed to the administrator of the channel
if the problem is channel related, or directly to the router administration for
the router you are connected to if it's something else. Be prepared to provide
any necessary documentation of incidents if the administrator you contact should
request them.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3BEEP~
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>
Syntax: i3beep [on]/[off]

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

Using on or off as an argument will enable or disable your ability
to send and receive i3beeps.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3CHANLAYOUT~
Syntax: i3chanlayout <localchannel> <layout> <format...>
Layout can be one of these: layout_e layout_m

Format can be any way you want it to look, provided you have the proper number of %s tags in it.

layout_e designs require 2 %s tags, one for the channel localname, and one for the message itself.

layout_m designs require 4 %s tags. One for the channel localname, one for the username, one for
the mudname, and one for the message itself.

Formats with incorrect amounts of tags will be rejected.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3CONFIG~
Syntax: i3config <options>

The interface to changing your configuration while in the mud.
Most options listed by typing in the command cannot be changed if you are currently
connected to I3 and they will inform you of this.

'i3config show' will list the details of what you can currently change with this
command. If something is not listed, then the only means to change it is to edit it
in shell. The output of the command should be fairly self explainitory.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3CONNECT I3DISCONNECT~
Syntax: i3connect
Syntax: i3disconnect

Pretty self explainitory. Each option does exactly what it implies.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3DEBUG~
Syntax: i3debug

When this option is on, all packets entering and leaving the mud are logged so
that they can be inspected later. This is really only of any value in the
deployment of new packet types that have not been tested, or in the addition of
new features that have yet to be implemented. It is not to be used lightly, for
it spams and is a gross invasion of privacy for anyone on the mud who may be
using tells. Responsible admins should either inform their users ahead of time or
use this option on a development port.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3EDITCHAN~
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> localname <new localname>
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> level <permission>

This allows you to change the local name of a channel, or to change the permission
level at which players can begin using it.

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
Syntax: i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3FINGER~
Syntax: i3finger <person@mud>
Syntax: i3finger privacy

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

Using the privacy argument will disable your information from being
sent to a requesting user on another mud. You will not be told anyone
has tried.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3IGNORE~
Syntax: i3ignore <target>
Syntax: i3ignore IP:Port

The I3IGNORE command blocks incoming traffic directed at a specific user on the mud.
It also prevents them from being displayed on such lists as who, and channel who.
This is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify ignores either specifically or with wildcards, like so:

i3ignore pest@mud
i3ignore *@mud
i3ignore pest@*
i3ignore IP:Port

The IP type of ignore can only be specified as an IP and port, taken from the mud's
current mudinfo data. This will block anyone current and future who logs into that
mud IP and port from ever sending you traffic.

Before going to the mud's administration with a complain, you should attempt to make
an ignore work for you. If the particular person is still causing problems or is
making a nuisance of themselves to several people, advise your mud administration
that they may need to pursue an I3BAN against the person or mud in question.
Be prepared to show proper documentation of any incidents to support your case.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3LOCATE~
Syntax: i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3PERMS~
Syntax: i3perms <user>

Displays the permission level for the target user on the mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3PERMSET~
Syntax: i3permset <user> <permission>

This command sets the permission level for a particular user on your mud.
The following permissions are available:

Notset - Default value. Causes subsequent logins to reset perms based on level.
None   - No access.
Mort   - Allows access to channels and commands for non-staff players.
Imm    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for regular staff.
Admin  - Allows access to additional channels and commands for administrative staff.
Imp    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for implementors.

These permission values are also used when setting channels up for access.

113 I3REMOVECHAN~
Syntax: i3removechan <channel>

Channelname should be the name seen on 'i3chanlist all'

Removed the indicated channel from the router, and deletes the local copy from the
mud as well. This does NOT send a broadcast to subscribed muds to delete their local
copies, so they will need to do that themselves upon noticing the channel is gone.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3SETCHAN~
Syntax: i3setchan <i3channelname> <localname> [permission]

This creates a local copy of an existing I3 channel for the mud to subscribe to.
You must use the I3 name of the channel so that your mud will know which one you
want. This is obtained from the 'i3chanlist all' command. You must then supply
a local channel name to use with it. Then you can optionally set a permission level
at which players can start using the channel. Channels with no permission level
supplied will default to "Mort".

An example:

i3setchan diku_chat dchat mort

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

~

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3tell [on]/[off]
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

Using the on or off arguments will enable or disable your ability to send
and receive i3tells.

~

103 I3UCACHE~
Syntax: i3ucache

Displays the current content of the mud's ucache data. This is a very spammy list
since multiple muds support this information and send packets out regularly.
Ucache data is used for gender targetting of socials.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3USER~
Syntax: i3user@mud

Sends out a specific request for the target user's ucache data and updates the
data tables accordingly.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3WHO~
Syntax: i3who <mud>

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

1 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).
 
Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.
 
~

31 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or power
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
 - your max levels in classes where intelligence would naturally relate.

Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
~

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC2 Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC2 enabled mud.

~

1 INTRODUCE~
At FotE we have an introduction system that is more RP focused than most.

&wSyntax:  introduce <player/all> <your preferred name>&W

If a character comes across another character, they will only know them
by their race, sex, build, and approximate height. However, when someone
introduces themself, such as &w'introduce <player> Admiral Thrawn'&W, or
&w'introduce all Admiral Thrawn'&W, that person or everyone on the room you
are in will see you, hear you, and look at you as 'Admiral Thrawn'.

You don't have to limit yourself to a name, though. You can introduce
yourself to an engineer as 'A customer', or introduce yourself to someone
who is gullible enough as 'An Imperial Tax Official'.

Disguises work a bit different here than from stock SWR, as well. No matter
whom you've introduced yourself to, your disguise will be what they see, hear,
and look at. If you want to look how you've introduced yourself, you can
type &wdisguise clear&W to remove it.

&RIt would be good to note that impersonation of an Immortal or introducing as
something that may be construed as offensive, lewd, or inappropriate to the
MUD's setting will not be tolerated. An infraction of this will result in any
punishment deemed necessary by an Immortal. Period.

0 ITHORIAN~
strange looking natives of Ithor, these creatures' heads appear to have
been stretched and bent like a ladle. The eyes are set at opposite sides
of the hammer-shaped top portion of the head, and their mouths are hidden
below on the   sloping part of the head. They have wide, flat feet
designed to keep their balance. They also have two throats, and this
biological phenomenon makes them hard to understand. This caused them a
great deal of pain when the Empire  discovered their planet, for the
Imperial xenophobia was heightened by their inability to communicate.
~

1 JAIL~
Syntax : jail <player>

Sends a stunned player to your clan's jail.
~

0 JAWA JAWAS~
Small, foul smelling creatures, Jawas live almost exclusively on Tatooine.
Their personal habits and way of life make them fairly repulsive to many
other races.  Their size does give them an edge on dexterity, and the
constant work they do on machinery gives them a similar edge in intelligence.
 
While over 99% of all Jawas live on Tatooine, some have been seen elsewhere.
The lower levels of Coruscant are rumored to harbor some, as well as a most
unlikely locale, Smuggler's Run.
~

1 JEDIS "JEDI KINGHT" JEDI~
.
     The Force is very rare in the Star Wars Univers, 
so to keep in reality, we have set it up so only 1 in
around 50 characters acctually has the Force.  If
you are Force capable , you will find out by training 
the meditate skill at luck and after much practice
you may become tunned to the Force. 
 
&R NOTE: Force is for 1 in 50 characters for a reason
         bugging IMM's to give you the force is not
         advised. Creating characters until you get 
         the force is also frownd upon by everyone.

0 KUBAZ~
an alien race hailing from the planet Kubindi, the Kubaz have dark green
skin, a prehensile trunk, and large eyes. Their eyes are sensitive to the
red spectrum of light, and often wear large goggles when they are away
from their homeworld.  They tend to be clan-oriented, with each clan
protecting its property from other rival clans. The intense solar flares
from their planet's sun nearly destroyed the majority of food sources on
the planet, and the Kubaz were forced to hunt  insects as a staple diet.
This led to the rival clans raiding each others' insect farms. They
eventually discovered space travel, and eventually populated three of the
11 worlds orbiting the sun Ku'Bakai. This ability to move  off-planet then
introduced the Kubaz to their neighbors, the Verpine. Since the Verpine
are an insectile race by nature, the space-faring Kubaz found that the
Verpine were tasty, and began to hunt them as an additional food source. 
~

1 LAND~
Syntax : land
Syntax : land <location>

This command lands the ship at the specified location or diplays the
available landing site.

0 LANGUAGES LANGUAGE LEARN~
Syntax: languages
Syntax: language learn <language name>

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn 
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a 
language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

Also see help on TONGUES.

31 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)

0 MON CALAMARI CALAMARIS "MON CALAMARI" "MON CALAMARIAN"~
The Mon Calamari are a race of shore-dwelling bipeds.  Living on a planet
almost totally covered with oceans, they have developed a symbiotic
relationship with the water-dwelling Quarren.  These inhabitants of the sea
mine ore from the ocean's floor and the Mon Calamari design practical uses
for it.  While they are not the most agile or tough race, their long
fight against the Empire has taught them many survival skills.
 
When the Empire came to Mon Calamari, it decimated the population and their
proliferate floating cities.  After months of fighting, the Imperial force
was repelled and the first collective action of the planet was to seek entry
into the Alliance.  The Mon Calamari also provided a great asset to the 
Alliance during the war, converting their numerous Pleasure Cruisers into 
machines of war, bringing much needed capitol ships to the Aliiance's forces.

-1 M_ADVHERO_~
Well done!

~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
You are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

clone
 
Here are a list of newbie friendly areas by planet:
 
Coruscant: Mountain School of Self Defence
Adari: Newbie Zone
Pluogus: Holochambers

-1 NMOTD~
Welcome to SWReality.
 
There is a help file to help you get started. Type "help newbie" to view it.
You also need to read the "help rules" file for obvious reasons.

If you notice that people are speaking gibberish thats probably because you
don't speak their language. ig. most humans don't understand wookie.
You'll have to learn other ways to communicate until you are able to learn
other languages ... see "help speak" for more info

Have fun .... :)
 
 
NOTE: We are still a very young mud and alot that maybe should be finished
isn't... please bear with us as we experience some of these early growing
pains.
 
&R Note: We just did a player wipe and ship wipe, so you will need to create a new character, even if you've previously had one here.&w

0 NOGHRI~
The Noghri are a race of great hunters and warriors.  Incredible agility
lend them a large advantage in combat.  For the most part, Noghri are
not technologically advanced, they lack any sort of "street smarts," as
almost none of them have ever gone offworld, and those that do only do so
as body guards and similar occupations.  Their small size also limits their
constition, and thus succumb to wounds more quickly than humans.
 
The Noghri live on the fourth planet in their system, the only one of seven
capable of supporting life.  Honoghr is, for the most part, a barren world.
Years ago, during the Clone Wars, a large starship crashed into the planet,
causing massive destruction and posoining much of the planet with coolant
fluids. Since, the Noghri have been extremely dependant on the Empire or
the New Republic for food.

30 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around. 
 
use: mset <mob#> flags nokill

and after that number.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking 
it in your inventory.

Notes now require a blank message disk to record :)

perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

31 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

Calamari with the Mon Calamari race, though the Quarren prefer the depths of 
the floating cities to the upper reaches the Mon Cals call home. The Quarren 
are more practical and conservative than their idealistic world-mates. Whereas 
the Mon Calamari have adopted the Basic as their language of choice, the 
Quarren have kept their oceanic tounge. The Quarren are sea dwellers, able to 
live out of the water, but preferring the security of the ocean depths, These 
pragmatic people are unwilling to trust new ideas. They do not dream of 
brighter tomorrows like the Mon Cals, but instead hold fast to the reality of 
yesterdays. While they profess that the two races should remain in the sea, 
they have followed the Mon Cals into their floating cities and out among the 
stars. They have become dependant on the Calamarians, and this dependancy has 
led to resentment and outright hatred. Rumors persist that it was a small 
number of Quarren who helped the Empire originally invade the planet. In the 
face of invading forces, Quarren cooperated with the Mon Calamari to repel the 
Imperials. But since that day, many Quarren have fled the planet to seek a life 
elsewhere in the galaxy. They seem to have purposely remained apart from both 
the Alliance and The Empire, preferring to find a place on the fringes of 
society. Quarren can often be found working with pirates, slavers, crime lords, 
smugglers, and other unsavory sorts.

prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.

assign are clear.

31 RESETSHIP~
Syntax : resetship <ship name>

Resets all the ships stats(including ownership) and returns it to its
original location.
~

1 RESIGN~
Syntax : resign

Resigns from your current clan.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, force points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

31 RESTORE~
Syntax:  restore <victim>
Syntax:  restore all
 
Restore returns the victim to full hitpoints, force and movement.
 
Restore all can be done once per day (real time) by any Saint and above,
and will 'restore' every link-live player in the game.  Restore alls such
as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.
 
See RESTORETIME
~

31 RESTORETIME~
Syntax:  restoretime
 
Displays the last 'restore all' performed by you, as well as the last
time a 'restore all' was done by anyone else.
 
See RESTORE
~

31 RESTRICT~
Syntax:  restrict <command> <level>
Syntax:  restrict <command> show

Used to restrict a command to a higher or lower level.  You cannot
rstrict a command you yourself cannot access.  Changes to a command's
level are not permanent unless they are saved using 'cedit save'.  A
command's level may also be changed using 'cedit'.
 
Use 'restrict <command> show' to see the level a command is currently
restricted to.
 
See CEDIT
~

31 RETIRE~
Syntax:  retire <immortal>
 
This command will 'retire' an active immortal and place them on the
wizlist under 'retired immortals'.  They will retain their level in
number only; they will be trusted to Savior level, and will have
access only to Savior-level commands.  They will not be able to see
logs of anyone higher than Savior, and their commands will be logged
as if they were a Savior.
 
A retired immortal can, however, manually be given a higher trust
level.
 
To bring an immortal out of retirement, simply 'retire immortal' again.
 
~

31 RETRAN~

Syntax: rlist
      :	rlist <first room>
      :	rlist <first room> <last room>

This command will list all of the prototype rooms in your area, when used 
with no arguments.  When used with a single argument it will list all 
rooms including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments, 
it will list all rooms including and between the two.

0 RODIAN RODIANS RODIA~
Rodians are among the Galaxy's best bounty hunters.  The history of Rodia
is peppered with wars and fueds, many of which are long and bloody.
Trained to fight from birth, they are amazingly agile and intelligent.
Though they almost never go into the scientific fields, their hand-to-hand
combat tactics are some of the best in the Galaxy.
 
For a long time before external contact was made, the Rodian people fought
and killed their own people.  When outside contact was established, they
quickly spread far and wide, seeking work as mercenaries, combat teachers,
assassins, body guards, and especially bounty hunters.  Rodain culture is
divided into different families.  Even now, families sometimes wage long
wars against each other, rather than moving against the outside war.

31 ROOM ROOMFLAG ROOMFLAGS~
Toggling the ROOMFLAG option in config will allow you to see
all the flags which are set ON in a room.  It also causes the

0 SELONIAN~
one of the three primary races in the Corellian System, the Selonians are
tall, strong, and quick. Often referred to as serious-minded and refined,
the  Selonians are well-muscled and covered with short, sleek fur, giving
them a seal-like appearance. They have bristly whiskers on their noses,
sharp teeth, and long tails. They are excellent swimmers. Taller and more
slender than  humans, they have long bodies and short limbs. Selonians are
equally comfortable walking upright or on all-fours. Each hand or foot is
equipped with retractable claws for climbing or defense. The Selonian race
is believed to be descended  from a predatory aquatic mammal which lived
in riverside burrows, but later dug deeper into the ground and farther
from water. Each burrow is inhabited by all members of a Selonian family;
collectively, they are called a sept. All  Selonians can also speak a
modified language of sounds that is used in their burrows.

1 SETBLASTER~
Syntax : setblaster <full|high|normal|half|low|stun>

Alters your blaster's power setting.
~

31 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

G#####       check if player has ##### amount of gold
H####        check if player has #### amount of hitpoints

Special operators:
+ don't consume this component
@ decrease component's value[0], and extract if it reaches 0
# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
^^ decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
&& decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the power fail if the caster is carrying that component.
 
Example: V1100 V+1101
The power will only succeed if the caster is carrying objects of vnums
1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the power,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.
 
With the decremental operators (@#$%^^&&), the object must have at least
a value of 1 in the respective location for the power to succeed.

~

1 STRENGTH STR~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Wookiees can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
 - your max levels in classes where strength would naturally relate.

0 SULLUSTAN~
This race of small, mouse-like humanoids were distinguished by their huge
black eyes, loose jowls, and pointed ears. They salivate quite often, and
live underground to avoid Sullust's inhospitable atmosphere. Their
ingenuity and  adaptability has allowed them to created huge underground
cities, and their technology has grown at an incredibly fast rate. They
have an intense sense of direction, having lived in caves all their lives,
and have the uncanny ability  to remember a path or map exactly, even
after the first time they see it. Thus, many of the Sullustans have become
pilots and navigators. Many Sullustans, after the age of 30 standard
years, begin to experience corneal defects, and must be  fitted with
special visors.

fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock
that needs opening or an item that needs to be stolen.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

31 TIMECMD~
Syntax:  timecmd <command>
Example: timecmd mpstat <mob>

Grand Admiral Molly Wintermute begins campaign against the New Republic.
Coruscant retaken, along with several previously Imperial planets. The Empire
appoints a new Emperor, Jent.

Emperor Jent Assassinated, his death is made to look like a suicide. Grand
Admiral Wintermute becomes Empress Wintermute, and rekindles the war.

Empress Molly assassinated by Koensayr, a reknowned bounty hunter. Her clone
vanishes from vats before imprinting. The Empire is thrown into a temporary
turmoil, and Grand Admiral Nfinet becomes Emperor. He resigns position after
a short tenure.

The hunter Koensayr is killed by Imperial forces, and the Empire regains

the terrorists flee. Imperial Defect Blevins killed while escaping, the
second party escapes clean. ISD Cataclysm severely damaged, and destroyed
while repair crews are working onboard. Emperor Sykar, overseeing the repair,
is presumed dead.

Yet again, more turmoil within the Empire... SSD Lusankya targets ISD Valor
with no obvious reasoning, and destroys it with several thousand personnel
onboard. Ensign Robb, also onboard at the time, manages to send a brief
distress signal before being killed. SSD Aggressor destroyed as well, by
unknown means.

After an extensive search, thousands of legions of stormtroopers are deployed
to Mon Calamari to seek out and terminate the Republic leader, Venex. A grand

arms, which end in wide, splayed fingers. Their heads are blunt, with beady red 
eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. Their scales range in color from orange 
to ochre to brown. Much of their body can be regenerated if lost, so a 
Trandoshan can fight much harder without risk of permanent injury. Being a 
vicious, warlike race, the Trandoshans evolved into hunters, and were

immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

~

0 TUNE~
Syntax: Tune <channel>
 
This command when in a ships cockpit allows you to tune a ships channel.
System talk is channel based so you will only hear comm traffic on the
channel your on.
~

0 TWI'LEK TWI'LEKS TWILEK~
Twi'lek is ther species name of the humanoid aliens with twin head tentacles. 
They come from the planet Ryloth, located in a system in the Outer Rim. The 
Twi'lek language combines verbal components with subtle head-tail movements. 
With the meanings provided by the head-tail movements, Twi'leks can carry on 
private conversations in the midst of other species. Twi'leks live in vast city 
complexes located on the planets dark side. Each complex is autonomous, 
goverened by a head clan of five Twi'leks who jointly oversee production, 
trade, and other daily endeavours. As the technology level of Ryloth does not 
support spacefaring capabilities, the Twi'leks must depend on neighboring 
systems (such as Tatooine), pirates, smugglers, and merchants for their contact 
with the rest of the galaxy. They attract these ships with their chief export, 
ryll. The mineral ryll has legitimate medicinal uses, but it is also a popular 
and dangerously addictive recreational substance used in the Corporate Sector. 
One hazard the Twi'leks face on a regular basis is slavers, who come to their 
world to fill their ships with Twi'lek slaves.

~

31 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax: unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE: It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already loaded,
      or one that has not been tested.
~

1 USE ACTIVATE~
.
Syntax : Use (item)
 
Quite obviously lets you use an item.
~

31 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

31 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

31 VARIABLES~
This is the list of variables to be used in actiondescs for objects and in
mob/room/object programs.

Syntax: feel ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This power throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~

0 VERPINE ROCHE "ROCHE ASTROID FIELD"~
Verpine are an advanced species of bipedal insectoids. Their thin, sticklike 
bodies have awkwardly articulated joints and chitinous shells. Two antennae jut 
from the sides of their heads, which have two large eyes and short snouts. The 
Verpine live in the Roche asteroid field, using great repulsor shells to keep 
occupied asteroids from crashing into each other and to deflect other bits of 
space debris. They are innate experts in most fields of technology, and their 
childlike fascinations with all types of machinery has served them well. They 
hollow out the asteroids for use as colonies, sealing them against space and 
filling them with all kinds of technological wonders. The Verpine have 
developed into expert starship builders. The Slayn & Korpil Corporation, named 
for two neighboring Verpine colonies, has been well known and respected since 
the days of the Old Republic. It was the Verpine who helped admiral ackbar 
design and build the B-Wing starfighters.
~

voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

31 VSEARCH~
Syntax:  vsearch <vnum of target object>

can be as long as three hundred years.
Wookiees are among the galaxy's greatest warriors.  They are not, however, 
mearly large stupid beasts.  While the inability to speak basic often portrays
them as huge, unthinking beasts, many are accomplished mechanics, engineers, 
and scientists.
