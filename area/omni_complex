You stand upon a cloud of pure white. The entire area is filled
with an endless sea of clouds. In the center of a room a throne
stands. The throne is white and looks to be made of glass. A
stream runs from the throne. The water is clear as crystal.
There is a godly atmosphere here.

Immortals Complex Prison Cell~
You enter a room with bright white lights, and soft padded walls. Gigantic
rats infest this god forsaken place. There is no exit, no doors, no escape
from this jail cell. All the inhabitants are trapped in here for the rest
of their lives. To the edge of the room, there is a skeleton rested
against the cell wall. God help his pathetic soul.

Before 777 Goodfeelin' St.~
Standing before this run down excuse for a shack one can see that the yard,
all of three yards in width runs in a band around to the rear of the hut.
Dark streaks of reddish brown mar the concrete walk up to the busted ass
doorway and the soil of the yard seems to have been recently tilled or
worked with a shovel, all of it. Odd bits of jewelry and two pair of
dentures lie half buried in the soil while the house itself looks like a
dead whore, still as death, pale as the moon, eyes sewn shut with large
planks and rusty nails. Back off to the southwest a stretch of suburban
houses intercede upon this haunt and the lackadaisical immortal's complex.

Bardock's Office~
The room is designed luxuriously and has a lot of elegant furniture spread
apart. To the west is a window displaying a view of a beautiful beach; a
work desk right in front of it. There is a couch here, along with a table
and some chairs for people to sit down and relax. There is also a
holovision screen to the north, along with many holomovies. Ancient
military weaponry are set up on racks as well as some Star Trek ships
hanging from the wall, protected by a strong duraglass alloy.
