Plus, there are no windows in the lower half of the building, replaced
with electronic eyes which provide more security. There are few guard
posts around here. Perhaps there are more deadly, hidden security
measures? The ground here is soft and muddy, kind of like a bog.
Squelching sounds can be heard as various small creatures move through the
swamp. Large trees and a thick mist surround, making visibility poor. One
would be wise to watch his or her step through this area.

Desc     The more expensive apartments are on this floor.  As you step onto the
landing you cant really tell the difference, and you assume it is probably
some ploy by the owners to make these rooms cost more for no reason. This
is the highest floor in the building. The view is the best here because it
is at a higher location and more of the city can be seen. The downside is
that it would take longer to get out of the building in case of an
emergency. The carpet here is a light gray and the walls are adorned with
beautiful wallpaper. Nice place to live.
