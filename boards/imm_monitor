<Success. Add mpadvances, mpwithdraws, etc, right here.>
mpat 101 drop <name of object>
mpat 101 mppurge

Is there a way for you coders to make a vending machine script? And maybe there can be a flag called vending or something so then I can make an object a vending machine.

Builders,

First off, want to thank you for making FotE a better place.
Second, want to ask a bit from you. Heh. One thing this mud
needs is variety of equipment. If you would, I'd prefer it if
you made your own blasters, etc in your areas so that people
have a feel for the broader range of equipment in the star wars
universe. Base your items off of currently existing items, just
modified some, though. We don't want anything overpowering :)

Any questions, ask Trillen.
-Tawnos

Area building just became a little bit easier.
Instead of goto'ing each room before you can use it, you can
now 'makefree <starting vnum> <end vnum>'.

An example:

You have area.are, vnums 1000-1500.
You type 'makefree 1000 1500'.
Vnums 1000 through 1500 are now available to be used.

Hey, it's almost idiotproof. :cough:

If arilyth comes on asking for a restore, do it. Her pfile got

went over quota. Hers was the only one that was lost.

With the advent of the new introduction system I think its time
I mentioned something..When building mobprogs, try to avoid
using names in echos (mpecho, mpechoaround, mpechoat) because,
roleplaywise, chances are good the mob you're building doesn't
actually know the players name. Thanks

How bout players can sit on furniture, and engineers can makefurniture, etc? 
Also, the player homes could be fitted to have special things for extra credits, such as door buzzers, slurpee machines, whatever...
Thats just my one cent.

Apparently we have a hacker. Hacked Nruden and Carthan. Not sure

Its a damned AOLer. Heres the IP info.

Caught Circe going linkdead and having Kincaid fly him/her to

set to pilot none, and warned about multiplaying.

Being in a non homicidal mood, didn't slay. Feel free to do so
on second offense.

Had quite the odd problem with Omicron and his connection consistently
sending Auth replies to us, causing the imms to get spammed
hardcore. I asked him to reconnect and it fixed itself. So,
future note, if you notice a lot of auth replies, check if omicron
is on. If he is, ask him to reconnect.If not, Keep disconnecting
people one by one until it stops, then when they reconnect ask
them to disconnect from their ISP and reconnect. Should fix
it.

Damned Polish ;) (joking)

Carissa, if you could beef up the special forces mobs (vnums 28, 31, and 34), that would be awesome.
