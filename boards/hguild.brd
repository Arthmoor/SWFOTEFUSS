Here are my findings upon going to bakura.

Bakura currently has no bounty office.
It has two workshops, and two bars.
There is a general store selling parts and supplies
A hotel is available to get some rest.
There is a blaster store selling the usuall blasters at the usual inflated prices.
There is a black market dealing with NR ships, specifically B, Y, and K wings.
They all cost about 300000 credits apiece.

There are many parts of Bakura that are still under construction, so bakura is not
limited to the things i have already mentioned.

Currently there are only two rules of the Hg.

1) Do not collect bounties on other Hg members
2) When doing a job for or against either the empire or nr
   do not bring the hg into it.  Any danger you bring upon yourself due
   to a job is not the responsibility of the Hg.  If you need somewhere to lay low,
   come to the base.

That is all the rules that there will most likely ever be during my session as leader.

Salaries will most likely not be coming untill a new leader is chosen.
if you have a salary you may either keep it or come to me to have it lowered or taken off.

you should have no trouble getting money with the abundance of jobs around.

Instead of salaries i will be spending money on buying more clan ships

if those who have money to spare could donate some it would be appreciated.

Hg members,

     All clan ships will be flyable by any member that has authority to.
you must be a top notch pilot and combat pilot to qualify.
this is effective immediately.

post any destruction of ships on this board and its cause.

Hg Members,

      Nyria is now leader of the Hg.
she is the  only one who seemed the least bit interested in leaedership or even in the hg itself
do not challenge her orders or you will have me to deal with

Verice, First of the Hg
